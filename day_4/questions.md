## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
The purpose of a method is to decrease the amount of repetitive code which saves time for the programmer but also
makes the code look a lot cleaner

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
hello_someone("Bailey")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
I still need to figure out the terminology to use when describing what I'm doing.  I stumble around the correct word usage.  Also I think adding in a lot of logic
to the methods, particularly those that assign values to variables, can get quite tricky. I will need more practice on those for sure.
